# UK Fund Performance Analysis

### [Link to Live Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/PerformancePersistenceofUKEquityFunds/Dashboard2?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Description

This project consists of a Python script that analyzes the performance of UK equity funds to investigate the "hot hands" phenomenon (i.e., whether past performance is a good predictor of future success). The script automatically downloads 6 years of market data for a sample of UK ETFs, calculates their performance, ranks them into groups ("Winners", "Middle", "Losers"), and exports the results to CSV files. These files are then used to build a comprehensive dashboard in Tableau to visualize the findings.

## Languages and Utilities Used

- Python
- pandas
- yfinance
- Tableau

## Environments Used

- Windows 10
- Python 3.12

## Program Walk-through:

The project followed a two-stage process: first, data processing in Python, and second, visualization in Tableau.

1.  **Data Processing in Python:**
    - The `analysis.py` script was developed to automate the entire data pipeline. When run, the script performs the following actions:
        - It programmatically downloads 6 years of monthly price data for 9 UK equity ETFs directly from Yahoo Finance.
        - It then calculates the trailing 12-month return for each fund at every month-end to use as a performance metric.
        - Based on this metric, it ranks all funds into three performance groups (tertiles).
        - Finally, it exports four clean CSV datasets, ready for visualization.

2.  **Visualization in Tableau:**
    - I connected Tableau to the four CSV files generated by the Python script.
    - Using this data, I built a dashboard comprised of four key visualizations to tell a clear analytical story:
        1.  A **Strategy Growth Line Chart** to show the headline result over time.
        2.  An **Average Monthly Return Bar Chart** to summarize the performance of each group.
        3.  A **Performance Stickiness Heatmap** to analyze the transition probabilities between ranks.
        4.  A **Fund Distribution Chart** to drill down into the behavior of individual funds.
    - These visualizations were arranged into the final dashboard, which is linked above.
